# Application Release Notes Summary

## v3.1 Test Specifications

### Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) Testing:
- Comprehensive test suite for FRL pipeline, including:

    - Testbed Environments: Unit-test style environments to validate core FRL algorithm behaviors (value/policy loss, reward propagation, deterministic convergence).
    - Heterogeneous Environments: Simulate real-world diversity and robustness by varying client conditions and rewards.
    - Interaction Tests: Validate configuration parsing, parameter exchange, and end-to-end model parameter handling.
    - Results: 20 test cases executed, with detailed pass/fail status for each. Most core behaviors pass; some edge cases (e.g., reward aggregation with varying episodes) highlight known limitations or expected deviations 

## v3.0 Test Specifications
### Regression Testing:
- Automated regression tests for cloud deployment, training, and inference workflows.

    - Status: Inference workflow integration is in progress 

## 2.4 Test Specifications
### Purpose:
High-level sanity checks for new features in release 2.4, using the "GIVEN...WHEN...THEN..." test case format.

### Regression Tests:
    - Cloud deployment: Influx (pending)
    - Cloud deployment: K-means training (PASS)
    - Edge deployment with Grafana (PASS)
    - Tests are systematically verified and results recorded per feature 

## 2.5 Test Specifications (from related release notes)
### Robustness on 500 Devices:
    - Goal: Demonstrate robust inference and federated learning (FL) on 500 intermittent devices (Android and Linux).
    - Focus: Validate completion, performance, and training duration under intermittent connectivity.
    - Outcome: Sequential experiments and configuration recommendations for users with intermittent devices 

## Testing Strategy and Format
### Quarterly Release Testing Strategy:
- Distinguishes between regression and new feature testing.
- Emphasizes high-level, scenario-based tests for new features, and automation for regression tests.
- Test cases use the "GIVEN...WHEN...THEN..." format for clarity and traceability 

### Regression Testing:
- Covers E2E flows: 
    - login, 
    - device onboarding, 
    - FL experiment setup, 
    - model review, deployment, 
    - drift detection, 
    - benchmarking, and 
    - usage reporting 

## Note:

- Test specifications are designed to ensure both new and existing functionalities are robust, generalizable, and meet customer needs.
- Detailed test results and links to specific test cases are available in the respective child pages for further review.
