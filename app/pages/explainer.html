    <h1>AGENT RECOMMENDATION</h1>
    <p id="AgentRecommendation">
        A modest increase in supply air temperature, from 22°C to 23°C, is recommended. Historical data for this site suggests each 0.5°C rise in supply air setpoint can cut chiller energy by 2-3%, given moderate IT load levels. This change provides approximately 2°C of safe margin if the setpoint is raised to 23°C. Raising the supply air temperature aligns with ISO50001 aims for monthly energy reductions and adheres to the EU Code of Conduct principle of avoiding unnecessarily low supply temperatures.
